Here is our task-2 of Oasis Infobyte (Python Programming internship)

BMI calculator :
Objective :-- The purpose of this program is to take weight (kg) and height (meters) from the user, calculate BMI, and show the health category based on BMI value.

Steps Performed :--

User enters weight and height.
Program checks if the inputs are valid (positive numbers).
BMI is calculated using the formula: BMI = Weight / (height * height)
Based on BMI value, the category is shown: 4.1. BMI < 18.5 â†’ Underweight 4.2. 18.5 â€“ 24.9 â†’ Normal 4.3. 25 â€“ 29.9 â†’ Overweight 4.4. â‰¥ 30 â†’ Obese
Program displays the BMI value and category to the user.
Tools Used :--

Python Programming Language.
Functions (calculate_bmi) â†’ For modular calculation.
Input/Output functions (input(), print()) â†’ For user interaction.
Exception Handling (try-except) â†’ To handle wrong inputs safely.
Conditional Statements (if-elif-else) â†’ For BMI categorization.
Outcome :-- 1. The program successfully calculates BMI based on user input. 2. It ensures safe input handling (avoids crashes if wrong values are entered). 3. Finally, it gives a clear health category message to the user (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese).

Console view :
â€‹=..=...= BMI Calculator =...=..= Enter your weight (in KG): 64 Enter your height (in Foot): 5.9 Result: Your BMI: 19.79 , (here the BMI is shown as per considering standered weight(meter) Category: Normal weight

Do you want to calculate again? (y/n): n

ðŸ‘‹ Thank you for using the BMI Calculator!
